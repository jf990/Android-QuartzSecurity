# Android-QuartzSecurity
An Android app demonstrating how to use Quartz runtime security services.

There is an accompanying MS Word document that explains everything. It will be converted to MD/HTML once the project is ready.

 - Login users
 - Get a list of the organizations available basemaps
 - Allow loading of a selected basemap
 - Load and display a feature service from that organization
 - Display popup info of a selected feature
 - Route to closest feature

## Follow up issues with Android team
1. If we use `new Portal(mPortalURL, true);` to login, how do we logout?
